            The story line of Spider-Man: Homecoming was not at par with The Spider-Man 1 (2002) and The Amazing Spider-Man 1 (2012), but still it managed to score good on Box office and 
            one the biggest reason was RDJ's supporting role in the movie. RDJ's name was enough to gether crowd in theaters. This movie also introduced one the badass Super-Villains i.e.
            Vulture. Unlike other villains of Spider-Man, the character of Vulture never appered in movies before this one. Till Homecoming Vulture appered only in comics and animated series
            "The Spectacular Spider-Man".<br/>
            Till date this franchise has released 3 parts and these are:<br/>
            1. Spider-Man: Homecoming.<br/>
            2. Spider-Man: Far From Home.<br>
            3. Spider-Man: No Way Home.<br/>
            Apart from these, few more parts are in progress.
            Tom Holland's Spider-Man was also introduces in Avengers franchise.
