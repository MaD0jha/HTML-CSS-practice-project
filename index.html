            The Super hero character Spider-Man is one of the most famous character in the world of comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe, especially amongs the teenagers. And the reason is teens find him very relatable, and 
            relation is created because the problem Peter faces in his daily life is quite similar to a normal. No we are not talking about the problem of fighting with Super-Villains, let Spider-Man handle them, the problems
            we are talking about are, Peter also get late on his bills and rent just like us, he has to do odd jobs like pizza delivary to pay the college fee, he to get bullied in college just like some normal guy and finally,
            he to get nervous in front of his secret crush Marry Jane (aka M.J), quite relatable right ?
